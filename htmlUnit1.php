        through suitable hardware and software to work in a seamless manner.
        Schematic diagram of Internet is shown in following fig. It allows various applications such as e-mail, file
        transfer, remote log-in, World-Wide-Web, Multimedia etc run across the Internet.</p>

        <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 100%; padding: 20px;">In 1969, the American defense department wanted to connect all the computers in the Department of
Defense (DOD) offices and military research contractors including a large number of universities doing
military funded research. That network was called Advanced Research Projects Agency Network
(ARPANET), was also called ARPANET, the D for defense<br>It started in a small way, connecting three computers in California with one in Utah, but quickly grew to
cover the whole area of America. It was very successful and all the universities wanted to get connected
to ARPANET. As time spent military officials wanted to preserve the unity of the DOD, and so divided the
network into two parts:</p>
        <ol type="i">
            <li>ARPANET</li>
            <li>MILNET(Military Network)</li>
        </ol><br>Network designers have designed several protocols now, and some of them are as follows:
        <ol style="list-style: disc">
            <li>Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)</li>
            <li>Point-to-Point Protocol (POP)</li>
            <li>Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</li>
            <li>Transfer Control Protocol/Internet Protocol(TCP/IP)</li>
        </ol>
        <br><br>

        Internet Protocol is a technical switching scheme, which enables a node of one network to communicate
with a node of another network. The American National Science Foundation then established another
network of computers in America. It permitted all the universities and research centers to hook on to
their network National Science Foundation Network (NSFNET) and to contribute to super-computer
research.<br></p><p>
During 1990, many computers started hooking up to NSFNET, and as a result ARPANET outlived its
usefulness and was shut down. During 1994, several commercial organizations introduced networks
across the globe. They also designed protocols to communicate from one node of a network to another
node in another network. As a result of this we now have a network of so many different networks. This
network of networks is called the Internet</p>
